Current error.nc - shows the error (maximum difference in coordinates by gauge) on all axes, at the last homing, in this session. On reboot, the current error is reset to zero.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Average error.nc - shows the arithmetic mean error (maximum difference in coordinates by approach) for all axes. Finds the arithmetic mean for cumulative error variables. Allows you to identify sensor problems. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reset average error.nc - resets cumulative error variables to zero, for all axes.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Test DA without relay.nc - allows you to test sensor operation, for dual axis circuit without relay. You just need to run the program and it will prompt you to enter the port numbers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Test DA with relay.nc - allows you to test the operation of sensors and relays, for double axis scheme with relay. You just need to run the program and it will prompt you to enter the port numbers.
