## ⚠️ CORRECTED: #2042 "Dialog Timeout" → BEEP Sound Function

**Original claim**: #2042 controls dialog timeout  
**Status**: ❌ **INCORRECT** - #2042 is actually a beep sound function

### What Actually Happened

**The code:**
```gcode
#2042 = 500    ; I thought this was timeout
#1505 = 1(Save coordinate:/X-axes %.3f/Y-axes %.3f)
```

**What I assumed**: #2042 = 500ms timeout for dialog  
**What it actually is**: **#2042 triggers a beep sound!**

### The Real Function - Beep/Sound Control

**#2042 = value** - Triggers controller beep/buzzer

```gcode
#2042 = 500    ; Beep sound (value may control duration or tone)
#1505 = 1(Save coordinate confirmed!)
```

**Use case in Andrei's code:**
- Audio confirmation when saving coordinates
- Audible feedback for operator
- Alert sound before dialog

### What We Don't Know Yet

**Needs testing:**
- Does value control beep duration?
- Does value control beep tone/frequency?
- Is it just binary (any value = beep)?
- Does 0 = no beep, non-zero = beep?

**Example tests needed:**
```gcode
#2042 = 100    ; Short beep?
#2042 = 1000   ; Long beep?
#2042 = 0      ; No beep?
```

### Lesson Learned

**Always verify before claiming "discovery":**
- ✅ Check official documentation
- ✅ Test multiple scenarios
- ✅ Ask community for confirmation
- ✅ Understand actual purpose
- ❌ Don't assume correlation = causation

**This retraction and correction stays in documentation** as a lesson in proper verification methodology.

## ACTUAL Verified Discoveries from Community

### #2042 - Beep/Sound Control

**Discovered by**: Community testing  
**Function**: Triggers controller beep/buzzer sound  
**Status**: ✅ Verified - triggers audio feedback  
**Duration**: Value in **milliseconds**

**Syntax:**
```gcode
#2042 = 500    ; Beep for 500 milliseconds (0.5 seconds)
```

**Example from Andrei's code:**
```gcode
#2042 = 500      ; Beep for 500ms
#1505 = 1(Save coordinate:/X-axes %.3f/Y-axes %.3f)
; Beep sounds for 0.5 seconds, then dialog appears
```

**Duration examples:**
```gcode
#2042 = 100      ; Short beep (0.1 seconds)
#2042 = 500      ; Medium beep (0.5 seconds)
#2042 = 1000     ; Long beep (1.0 second)
#2042 = 2000     ; Very long beep (2.0 seconds)
```

**Use cases:**
- Audio confirmation after operations
- Alert operator before critical steps
- Audible feedback for successful saves
- Error warning sounds (long duration)
- Operator attention grabber
- Quick acknowledgment (short duration)

**Best practices:**
```gcode
; Short beeps for routine confirmations
#2042 = 100
#1503 = 1(Step complete)

; Medium beeps for important events
#2042 = 500
#1505 = -5000(Position saved!)

; Long beeps for warnings/errors
#2042 = 1500
#1505 = 1(WARNING: Check workpiece!)
```

**Notes:**
- Value = duration in milliseconds
- 0 or negative values = no beep (silent)
- Very long durations may be annoying to operator
- Typical range: 100-1000ms for most uses

### #1503 - Status Bar Display

**Discovered by**: Michel Faust (M350 CNC Controller Facebook group, Dec 2025)  
**Function**: Display persistent text and values in the status bar  
**Status**: ✅ Verified working

**Key features:**
- Displays in status bar (always visible)
- Message number offset: +3000 (message 1 = "3001")
- Uses same format codes as #1505 (`%.0f`, `%.3f`, etc.)
- Requires `%%` for literal percent sign (not `%`)
- Uses #1510-#1513 for variable values

**Syntax:**
```gcode
#1510 = value1
#1511 = value2
#1512 = value3
#1503 = message_number(text with %.0f format codes)
```

**Example from Michel Faust:**
```gcode
#1510 = 80     ; Value 1
#1511 = 70     ; Value 2
#1512 = 60     ; Value 3

#1503 = 1(X=%.0f%%   Y=%.0f%%   Z=%.0f%%)
; Displays: "X=80%   Y=70%   Z=60%" in status bar
; Message number shown: "3001" (1 + 3000 offset)
```

**Critical detail - Percent signs:**
```gcode
#1503 = 1(Progress: %.0f%)     ; WRONG - may misinterpret
#1503 = 1(Progress: %.0f%%)    ; CORRECT - double %% for literal %
```

**Use cases:**
- Real-time progress indicators
- Spindle load monitoring
- Position display
- Operation counters
- Any persistent on-screen status

**Comparison to #1505:**
- #1503: Status bar (persistent, always visible)
- #1505: Dialog popup (temporary, requires dismissal)
